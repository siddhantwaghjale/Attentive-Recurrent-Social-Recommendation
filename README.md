# IR-Project
Information Retrieval Project for Team : Nihar, Ritvik, Siddhant

## Introduction
1.]Developing an algorithm devise a social media recommen-dation  system  of  users  and  products  based  on  static  anddynamic changes of each user using the Epinions and Gowalladataset
2.]LSTM-RNN  model  along  with  dynamic  time  measureneeds  to  be  implemented  for  SARSE  (Static  Atten-tive  Recurrent  Social  rEcommendation)  and  DARSE(Dynamic Attentive Recurrent Social rEcommendation)combining which will give us the final ARSE (AttentiveReccurent Social rEcommendation)

## Requirements
Python3.6
keras
matplotlib
scipy

## To run
Extract both datasets from data folder
Store datasets in data folder and run the python program using python3 ir.py
